                            When teams use <strong>Play,</strong> everyone can experience the product as it evolves, working collaboratively in real-time.

                            Features like commenting and chat along with Play’s built-in sharing functionality, put collaboration features in context

                        If your team is selected, we will reach out to collect the emails of your additional team members and distribute Beta keys.
                         If you signed up previously as an individual, please note that on the form and once verified, your application will be prioritized.
